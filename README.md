🛣️ Ola Insights Explorer
Power BI Dashboard & SQL Analysis of 20,000+ Ola Ride Records

About the Project:

Ola Insights Explorer is a data analytics project focused on exploring and visualizing ride data from Ola, a leading ride-hailing service. The dataset contains over 20,000 ride records, and the project combines the power of SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard that provides meaningful insights into the operations and trends within the ride-sharing platform.

The primary goal of this project is to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights that can assist in understanding customer behavior, operational efficiency, and ride patterns. This can help businesses like Ola make data-driven decisions to enhance service quality and optimize operations.

Using SQL, the data was cleaned, filtered, and aggregated to prepare it for analysis. Power BI was then used to create a dashboard that showcases key metrics and trends such as total rides, revenue generation, peak ride hours, preferred payment methods, and city-wise ride distribution.
